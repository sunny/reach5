## Usage

  provider: "facebook",
  provider_token: "f00b4r",
  user_agent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) â€¦",
)
```

## Installation

Add these lines to your application's Gemfile:

```rb
# Reach5 Customer Identity Management Platform API
gem "reach5", git: "https://github.com/sunny/reach5"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle


## Configuration

```rb
Reach5.configure do |c|
  c.customer_domain = "YOUR_CUSTOMER_DOMAIN"
  c.client_key = "YOUR_CLIENT_KEY"
  c.client_secret = "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_TOKEN"
end
```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake` to run the specs and style checker.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you
to experiment. You can place your configuration in the untracked `./console.rb`
file to have it loaded whenever you load the console.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, update the
`CHANGELOG.md` and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git
tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file
to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
